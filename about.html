				<h2> Gleneagles Physics - About </h2>

				<p> My name is Adam Vulic, a maths and physics teacher at Gleneagles Secondary College. </p>
				
				<p> I created this website first and foremost to improve my HTML and CSS skills. All the content I've created on this website is generally made available to students in my class through Microsoft Onenote. But I realised that teaching resources shouldn't be kept private, so I'm hosting all my resources on here as well. </p>
				
				<p> The site was officially created in 2017. Currently, the pages are hosted on GitHub, since it provides a free service and no ads. Depending on the future needs of the site, it may get migrated to another webhost. </p>
				
				<p> You can contact me by email at <b>vulic.adam.m@edumail.vic.gov.au</b>. </p>
