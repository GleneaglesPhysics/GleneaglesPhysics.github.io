				<h2> Gleneagles Physics Home </h2>

				<p> Welcome to the Glenealges Physics page. This website has been set up for you to find easy access to the course content such as notes, presentations, problem sets, practice SACs, exam revision, and more. </p>
				
				<p> This site is still in its infancy, and as such, functionality is limited (I'm still learning how to make websites!). Please take a look around, even if you're not from Gleneagles as there are plenty of free resources to go around. </p>
				
				<p> Unfortunately due to copyright laws, I can't provide SACs or exams which have been written by a proprietary company. If you attend my classes, these bought SACs and exams will be available on Onenote, as well as all of the content on this site. </p>
